The Forge-Viewer-Family-Revit repository aims to provide a web application that allows users to visualize Revit models using the Revit Forge Viewer, integrating a stack based on MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js).

Main Features:
Model Visualization: Enables users to view and interact with 3D Revit models in an interactive web environment.

Data Storage: Uses MongoDB to store metadata and data associated with the models, facilitating the management of large volumes of information.

Interactivity: Thanks to React, the user interface is dynamic and responsive, enhancing the user experience.

Backend: Node.js and Express handle server requests and interactions with the database, ensuring efficient data flow.

Benefits:
Accessibility: Models can be viewed from anywhere via a web browser.
Collaboration: Facilitates collaboration among design and construction teams by providing easy access to the models.
Integration: Allows the integration of various functionalities and tools within the same application.
